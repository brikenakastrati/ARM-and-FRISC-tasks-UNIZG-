### ARM and FRISC assembly tasks done for the course Computer Architecture 1R during my exchange semester at University of Zagreb (FER)
##### In this repository are uploaded the assembly tasks and their solutions using SSPARCSS simulator and assembler. The first two tasks are for ARM processor and the last one is for FRISC.
##### FRISC (FER RISC) is the name for the architecture of RISC processors designed within the RASIP group on FER and used for research and in the course Computer Architecture 1R.
